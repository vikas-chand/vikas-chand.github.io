I work on high-energy transients with a focus on physics-driven modeling and inference.

- Gamma-ray bursts (prompt + afterglow)
- Magnetar giant flares and high-energy counterparts
- Fermi-LAT likelihood analyses and stacking
- Orphan afterglows and survey detectability
- Machine learning applications in high-energy astrophysics
