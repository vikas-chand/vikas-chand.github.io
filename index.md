Welcome to my personal website. I am a researcher specializing in **High-Energy Astrophysics**, with a particular focus on **Magnetars** and **Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs)**.

I analyze data from missions like **Fermi-LAT** and **GBM** to understand the most energetic events in the universe. My work involves creating synchrotron models, conducting stacking analyses of giant flares, and developing software for scientific data analysis.
